#  Generic color configuration file (included in SaLoMon) for log files.     #

#  This file was created primarily for the sample log file 'foobar.log',     #
#  (which is included inside the 'samples' sub-directory), but is also       #
#  suitable for other logs. Details can be found inside the quick start      #
#  guide inside the SaLoMon wiki:                                            #
