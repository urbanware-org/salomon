shell_precheck() {
    command -v bash >/dev/null 2>&1
    if [ "$?" != "0" ]; then
        cat <<- end

Salomon cannot be run.

The reason for this is that the Bash shell does not seem to be installed. For
Salomon, the Bash shell is a mandatory dependency and so it will not work
without it.

No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell (version 4 or higher) must
be installed in order to use Salomon as it takes advantage of certain features
provided by the Bash shell.

end
        exit 1
    elif [ ! -n "$BASH" ]; then
        cat <<- end

Salomon cannot be run.

The reason for this is that all of its components require the Bash shell in
order to run and this script has determined that it was (maybe explicitly)
executed with a different one which is not supported.

You may run the compatibility check script ('compat.sh') for details.

        if [ $bash_major -lt 4 ]; then
            cat <<- end

Salomon cannot be run.

The reason for this is that it requires at least version 4 of the Bash shell
and the currently installed version is $bash_version which is not supported.
