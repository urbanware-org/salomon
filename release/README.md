# Building a customized release

The repository clone of *Salomon* comes with `make.sh` some sort of release builder script. As this statement suggests, it is not a part in the official release.

This script is used to create the archive and the corresponding checksum file for the official releases of the *GitHub* repository.

Nevertheless, you can create an archive for your own purposes (with customized scripts, color schemes, filters, etc.).

However, in case you want to share your customized version, a corresponding notice is required that it is not an official release.

Please note the following:

*   The original files `README` and `CHANGELOG` must remain untouched.

*   The file `MODIFIED` must be created and placed in the same directory where the above files are located.

*   This file must contain all information about the customized version (author, modifications, changelog etc.). See the `MODIFIED` example file.
