Modified Salomon version

Some modification of Salomon which makes all output lines flash in random
colors which is absolutely useless. However, that does not matter as this file
is just an example for a file that indicates the version of Salomon has been
modified. The structure of the file is up to you, it just needs to contain the
required information.
