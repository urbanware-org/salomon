
REQUIREMENTS (SaLoMon)

    The SaLoMon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell, which is
    the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least Linux
    distributions).

    So, no matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell (version 4 or
    higher) must be installed in order to use SaLoMon.

    Additional package requirements (should be pre-installed):

        - coreutils (version 2.85 or higher is recommended)
        - grep (version 2.18 or higher is recommended)
        - sed (version 2.50 or higher is recommended)

    Optional package requirements:

        In order to use the interactive dialog feature, a dialog tool must be
        installed, which usually is included by default in the system.

        Supported tools are 'dialog' (or 'cdialog') and 'whiptail'.

            - dialog (version 1.1 or higher is recommended)
            - whiptail (version 0.52.1 or higher is recommended)

        Notice that this feature will not work with 'Xdialog' as SaLoMon is
        text-based user interface intended.

    All the recommended versions of the required utilities mentioned above are
    the ones that have been used while developing SaLoMon. The project also
    works most likely with earlier versions.

    You may run the compatibility check script 'compat.sh' to get a quick
    overview if all requirements are fulfilled.
