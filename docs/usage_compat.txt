    1. Definition

        The Salomon compatibility script checks if Salomon will run in the
        current environment.

    2. Shell requirements

        The Salomon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell, which
        is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least on many
        Linux distributions).

        No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell (version 4 or
        higher) must be installed in order to use the Salomon project. As a
        matter of fact, the Salomon project takes advantage of certain
        features provided by the Bash shell.

        Due to the shebang in the header of each script file, each component
        uses the Bash shell, even if the script is being run on another shell.

    3. Compatibility check

        To check if Salomon will work in the current environment, simply run
        the compatibility check script without any arguments (there are no
        command-line arguments available anyway) and check the results.

            ./compat.sh

    4. Exit codes

        If you want to redirect or suppress the standard output, you can
        evaluate the exit codes of the script as follows:

            0 - Compatibility check succeeded
            1 - Bash shell missing or not used to execute the script
            2 - Compatibility check failed
            3 - Compatibility check succeeded, except for optional tools
