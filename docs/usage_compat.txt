    1. Definition

        The SaLoMon compatibility script checks if SaLoMon will run in the
        current environment.

    2. Shell requirements

        The SaLoMon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell, which
        is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least on many
        Linux distributions).

        No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell must be installed
        in order to use SaLoMon. As a matter of fact, the SaLoMon project
        takes advantage of certain features provided by the Bash shell.

        Due to the shebang in the header of each script file, each component
        uses the Bash shell, even if the script is being run on another shell.

        Without the Bash shell, the scripts can also be executed, but will
        either not work properly or most likely not work at all. Maybe there
        are other shells which provide the features needed, but there is no
        guarantee for that.

    3. Compatibility check

        To check the compatibility, simply run the compatibility check script
        without any arguments. There are no command-line arguments anyway.

            $ ./compat.sh
