    1. Definition

        The Salomon dialog-based help script simply displays the included
        documentation files using a shell dialog tool.

    2. Details

        The main purpose of this script is that you can read the documentation
        (the usage information files from the 'docs' sub-directory) on the
        graphical user interface using a shortcut instead of opening them with
        a text editor or reading them on the shell by using a shell command
        such as 'cat', 'more' or 'less'.

    3. Requirements

        The Salomon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell, which
        is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least on many
        Linux distributions).

        No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell (version 4.3 or
        higher) must be installed in order to use the Salomon project.

        See the 'REQUIREMENTS' file for further information.

    4. Displaying a help file

        Simply run the help dialog display script without any arguments (there
        are no command-line arguments available anyway) and select the usage
        information file you wish to read.

            ./help.sh
