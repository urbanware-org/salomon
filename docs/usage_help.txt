    1. Definition

        The Salomon dialog-based help script simply displays the included
        documentation files using a shell dialog tool.

    2. Details

        The main purpose of this script is that you can read the documentation
        (the usage information files from the 'docs' sub-directory) on the
        graphical user interface using a shortcut instead of opening them with
        a text editor or reading them on the shell by using a shell tool such
        as 'cat', 'more' or 'less'.

    3. Requirements

        3.1 Shell environment

            The Salomon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell,
            which is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least
            on many Linux distributions).

            No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell (version 4 or
            higher) must be installed in order to use the Salomon project. As
            a matter of fact, the Salomon project takes advantage of certain
            features provided by the Bash shell.

            Due to the shebang in the header of each script file, they are run
            using the Bash shell, even if the scripts are being executed on
            another shell.

        3.2. Dialog tool

            In order to display the documentation files with dialogs, either
            'dialog' or the 'whiptail' tool must be installed.

    4. Displaying a help file

        Simply run the help dialog display script without any arguments (there
        are no command-line arguments available anyway) and select the usage
        information file you wish to read.

            ./help.sh
