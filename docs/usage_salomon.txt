    2. General stuff

        2.1 Overview of all command-line arguments

            The script requires command-line arguments to operate. You can get
            an overview of all arguments available, by simply running the main
            script with the '--help' argument:

                ./salomon.sh --help

        2.2 Shell requirements

            The Salomon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell,
            which is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least
            on many Linux distributions).

            No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell (version 4 or
            higher) must be installed in order to use the project.

            Further information can be found inside the included documentation
            for the shell compatibility script.

        2.3 Colorize and highlight certain lines

            In first place, Salomon has been developed to monitor and analyze
            files by colorizing lines which contain certain terms (which can
            also be additionally highlighted) to get a fast overview of the
            contents (e.g. to easily detect error messages inside log files).

            2.3.1 Color config files

                Inside the 'colors' sub-directory there is a sample color
                config file named 'sample_colors.cfg'. It can be used to
                colorize lines containing certain terms with user-defined
                colors. This sample config file also contains some simple
                usage examples how to do this.

            2.3.2 Highlight filter terms

                The '--highlight-matches' command-line argument allows to also
                highlight the filter terms inside the corresponding lines by
                inverting their colors (sort of marker pen like). It requires
                a filter, but can be used with as well as without a color
                config file.

                You may also use '--highlight-upper' instead, which works the
                same way and additionally switches the letters of the filter
                terms to uppercase.

            2.3.3 Highlight whole lines

                Instead of only highlighting the filter terms, you can also
                highlight the whole line using '--highlight-all'. This does
                neither require a color config file nor a filter.

                If you want to remove the trailing whitespaces used to fill
                the highlighted lines, add the '--cut-off' argument.

        2.4 Config file paths

            You do not have to give the full path to the config files for
            Salomon if these are located in the corresponding sub-directories.

            So, in case you only give the file name (instead of the path) for
            the color or filter config like this:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c colors.cfg \
                             -f filter.cfg

            Salomon will first check the current working directory for these
            config files. If these do not exist there, it will check for them
            inside the config sub-directories ('colors' and 'filters') of the
            Salomon script directory.

        2.5 File paths containing spaces and special characters

            Usually, paths containing spaces and special characters are simply
            enclosed with either single (') or double (") quotes.

            If you do not want to enclose the whole path for some reason, you
            have to escape spaces as well as special characters such as quotes
            or backslashes inside the file name.

            Notice that each of those characters must be escaped which also
            applies to consecutive ones.

            Due to the fact, that backslashes are escape characters, it is
            most unlikely that a file path contains any. However, if it does,
            backslashes must also be escaped.

            Below you can find a few examples of escaped characters.

            2.5.1 Whitespaces

                Single space:

                    File path:  /home/johndoe/server mails.log
                    Escaped:    /home/johndoe/server\ mails.log

                Multiple spaces:

                    File path:  /home/johndoe/server user logins.log
                    Escaped:    /home/johndoe/server\ user\ logins.log

                Multiple spaces (consecutively):

                    File path:  /home/johndoe/server   user logins.log
                    Escaped:    /home/johndoe/server\ \ \ user\ logins.log

            2.5.2 Quotation marks

                Single quotes:

                    File path:  /home/johndoe/output of 'tail'.log
                    Escaped:    /home/johndoe/output\ of\ \'tail\'.log

                Double quotes:

                    File path:  /home/johndoe/output of "tail".log
                    Escaped:    /home/johndoe/output\ of\ \"tail\".log

            2.5.3 Backslashes

                Most unlikely, but just in case:

                    File path:  /home/johndoe/foo\bar.log
                    Escaped:    /home/johndoe/foo\\bar.log

        2.6 Interactive dialogs

            You can use interactive dialogs instead of or in combination with
            command-line arguments by giving either the '--interactive' or
            '--dialogs' argument:

                ./salomon.sh --dialogs

            However, if you give further arguments like this

                ./salomon.sh --dialogs -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg

            the values will be automatically applied to the dialogs. For
            example, the dialog window asking for the input file will already
            contain '/var/log/foobar.log', which can still be changed.

            The dialogs inside the text-based user interface can be displayed
            using the tools 'dialog' and 'whiptail'. By default, Salomon does
            automatically detect which of both is installed and uses the
            corresponding one. If both are, 'dialog' is being preferred.

            However, you also can explicitly set the one that should be used
            inside the 'salomon.cfg' config file. For example, if you want to
            only use 'whiptail', edit the file and set the value of the option
            'dialog_program' from 'auto' to 'whiptail':

                dialog_program=whiptail

            Furthermore, inside that config file you can set which dialogs
            should be shown when using interactive mode. For example, if you
            want to disable the welcome dialog change the value of the option

                dialog_show_welcome=1

            to the following:

                dialog_show_welcome=0

    3. Process input files

        There are different ways to process the given input file or files.

        3.1 Relevant keystrokes

            The Salomon process (no matter if monitoring or analyzing) can be
            canceled at any time by pressing the universal and well-known
            <Ctrl>+<C> keystroke.

            By pressing <Ctrl>+<S> the output freezes until defreezing it
            again using <Ctrl>+<Q>.

            Notice that when in monitoring mode no lines will be lost. As soon
            as you defreeze the output, the lines that would have been shown
            in the meantime will be printed afterwards.

            Salomon also provides an optional pause feature based on the
            number of output lines, see section 8 below.

        3.2 Monitor a file

            This feature uses the follow mode of the 'tail' utility to return
            the lines of the file and colorizes the output with user-defined
            colors. The file will be monitored until the user cancels the
            process.

            For example, to monitor the file '/var/log/foobar.log' using the
            color file 'log_colors.cfg' to colorize certain lines:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg

            Alternatively, you can also give the '--monitor' command-line
            argument:

                ./salomon.sh --monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg

        3.3 Analyze a file

            Instead of monitoring a file, it is also possible to analyze it.
            This will simply return its lines and colorize certain of them,
            then exit.

            For example, to analyze the file '/var/log/foobar.log' using the
            color file 'log_colors.cfg' to colorize certain lines:

                ./salomon.sh -a analyze -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg

            Alternatively, you can also give the '--analyze' command-line
            argument:

                ./salomon.sh --analyze -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg

        3.4 Multiple input files

            You can also provide multiple (two or more) input files at once.

            When monitoring multiple files a separator will be displayed that
            shows to which file a new line was last added and when analyzing
            they will simply be processed one by another.

            For example, to monitor '/var/log/foo.log' and '/var/log/bar.log'
            using the color file 'log_colors.cfg' to colorize certain lines:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -c log_colors.cfg \
                             -i /var/log/foo.log -i /var/log/bar.log

            Notice that the '-i' argument is required for each input file
            given.

        3.5 Merge multiple input files

            This feature is primarily intended for analyzing multiple files.

            Usually, the files are processed one after another by default.
            However, in some cases it is useful to be able to merge several
            log files of the same type (e.g. mail logs) into one, especially
            when working with timestamps.

            This can simply be done using the '--merge' argument. For example:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -c log_colors.cfg --merge \
                             -i /var/log/maillog_1.log \
                             -i /var/log/maillog_2.log \
                             -i /var/log/maillog_3.log

            When using '--merge' with monitoring mode, it simply removes the
            file separators from the output.

        3.6 Input file without path

            In case a given input file path does not exist, Salomon also
            checks the default log file path '/var/log' for the file.

            For example, if you execute the following command

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i foobar.log

            and the given file 'foobar.log' does not exist inside the current
            working directory, Salomon also checks for '/var/log/foobar.log'.

    4. Applying a filter

        It is possible to filter the output to e.g. only return lines that
        contain certain terms. There is also the optional '--ignore-case'
        argument to ignore the case of the given filter pattern.

        The filter pattern also allows spaces, including leading and trailing
        ones.

        4.1 Filter pattern

            For example, to only return lines that contain the term "error",
            you can use the filter argument as follows:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg -f error

            The pattern also allows spaces, but when using such the criteria
            must be enclosed either with single (') or double (") quotes, for
            example:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg -f "error while"

            This will return lines that contain the term "error while", but no
            lines which contain only one of those words.

            In case this does not work properly for whatever reason, you may
            try escaping the space (each of them if there are multiple) using
            a backslash like this:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg -f "error\ while"

            Furthermore, the pattern allows multiple terms. These must be
            separated with semicolons and be enclosed either with single (')
            or double (") quotes, for example:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg -f "error;warning;success"

            This will return lines that contain one of those terms.

            A combination of spaces and multiple terms inside the pattern also
            is supported:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg \
                             -f "error while;warning;success"

        4.2 Filter config file

            Even though, the help output of the script returns that the filter
            argument expects a pattern, it is also possible to give a config
            file containing the pattern.

            Inside the 'filters' sub-directory there is a sample filter config
            file named 'sample_filter.cfg'. This file contains usage examples
            how to filter the output.

            For example, to use that file as filter pattern:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg -f sample_filter.cfg

            Notice that in case the file does not exist, the script will
            interpret the given path as a pattern instead of a file path.

    5. Exclude lines

        Sometimes it makes sense to exclude lines to get a clearer output.

        For example, to exclude all lines containing the string "example":

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -e example

        The exclude pattern also allows spaces, including leading and trailing
        ones. When using spaces, the string must be enclosed either with
        single (') or double (") quotes, for example:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -e "example for"

        This will exclude lines that contain the term "example for", but no
        lines which contain only one of those words.

        In case this does not work properly for whatever reason, you may try
        escaping the space (each of them if there are multiple) using a
        backslash like this:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -e "example\ for"

        Furthermore, the pattern allows multiple exclude terms. These must be
        separated with semicolons and be enclosed either with single (') or
        double (") quotes, for example:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -e "example;foo;bar"

        This will exclude lines that contain at least one of those terms.

        A combination of spaces and multiple terms inside the exclude pattern
        also is supported:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -e "example for;foo;bar"

    6. Remove certain strings

        In some case it also makes sense to remove strings to get a clearer
        output.

        For example, to remove the string "example" from all output lines:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -r example

        The remove pattern also allows spaces, including leading and trailing
        ones. When using spaces, the string must be enclosed either with
        single (') or double (") quotes, for example:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -r "example for"

        This will remove the string "example for", but not just one of those
        words.

        In case this does not work properly for whatever reason, you may try
        escaping the space (each of them if there are multiple) using a
        backslash like this:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -r "example\ for"

        Furthermore, the pattern allows multiple remove terms. These must be
        separated with semicolons and be enclosed either with single (') or
        double (") quotes, for example:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -r "example;foo;bar"

        This will remove all of the given terms from the corresponding lines.

        A combination of spaces and multiple terms inside the remove pattern
        also is supported:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         -r "example for ;foo;bar"

    7. Head and tail feature

        Notice that both features do not work with multiple input files. When
        analyzing a large file it may take a while until the whole file has
        been printed on the output.

        Salomon provides are two arguments to simply return a certain amount
        of lines.

        7.1 Head feature

            For example, if you just need the first 30 lines of a log file,
            you can use the '--head' command-line argument:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg --head 30

        7.2 Tail feature

            For example, if you just need the last 30 lines of a log file, you
            can use the '--tail' command-line argument:

                ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                             -c log_colors.cfg --tail 30

    8. Pause output

        When analyzing large files, the output can be very cluttered. With
        the '--pause' argument you can pause the output either after user-
        defined amount of lines or automatically by determining the number
        of lines of the terminal Salomon is currently running in.

        For example, to pause the output after 30 lines, the command would
        look like this:

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log --pause 30

        When you give 'auto' instead of a number, Salomon determines the
        height of the terminal (number of lines) and pauses based on that
        value.

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log --pause auto

        When the corresponding number of lines is reached, a typical "Press
        any key to continue" message appears. As this already suggests, the
        output continues after pressing a key.

        However, you should avoid pressing certain keys such as the delete
        key, arrow keys, F-keys and the right-click keyboard shortcut, as this
        will result in skipping pauses.

    9. Export output into a file

        You can simultaneously write the output of Salomon into a file
        including the colors and highlighting.

        The purpose of this feature is that you have an exact copy of the
        relevant output displayed on the screen requiring neither the original
        log file nor the appropriate Salomon command-line arguments.

        For example, to export the output of the following command

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log \
                         -c log_colors.cfg

        into the file '/home/johndoe/export.log':

            ./salomon.sh -a monitor -i /var/log/foobar.log -c log_colors.cfg \
                         --export-file /home/johndoe/export.log

        Now, by using e.g. 'cat' you can display the exported data as seen in
        the output. You do not even need Salomon for that as the exported file
        contains the required color and highlighting codes.

        However, editing the file with an editor will not work, due to the
        fact, that the editor will (or should) also print these codes instead
        of interpreting them.
