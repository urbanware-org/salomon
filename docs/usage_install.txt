    1. Definition

        The Salomon installation script allows to install and uninstall the
        project, which is optional and not mandatory in order to use it.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 Overview of all command-line arguments

            The script requires command-line arguments to operate. You can get
            an overview of all arguments available, by simply running the
            script with the '--help' argument.

        2.2 Shell requirements

            The Salomon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell,
            which is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least
            on many Linux distributions).

            No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell must be
            installed in order to use the project.

            Further information can be found inside the included documentation
            for the shell compatibility script.

    3. Verify archive integrity

        Since version 1.18.3 there is a checksum file to verify the integrity
        of the downloaded salomon-release archive. When downloading Salomon
        from its official repository, verifying the downloaded file is not
        mandatory.

        However, when downloading the archive from a different location, it
        might have been modified (in a not necessarily negative way), e.g.
        enhanced with additional color config files or whatever. As with any
        software, you should check it before running or installing it with
        superuser privileges.

        In order to verify the integrity of the archive you have downloaded,
        you will need the corresponding checksum file.

        For example, if you want to verify the file

            salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz

        download the checksum file

            salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz.sha256

        directly from the assets of the official release, with this particular
        version:
        
            https://github.com/urbanware-org/salomon/releases/tag/1.18.3

        Then, copy the checksum file into the same directory from the archive
        and execute the following shell command:

            sha256sum -c salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz.sha256

        In case the archive is identical with the one from the official
        release, the command will confirm this as follows:

            salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz: OK

    4. Install Salomon

        Notice that this process requires superuser privileges.

        The project will be installed to '/opt/salomon' and a symbolic link to
        its main script will be created in '/usr/local/bin' by default. If the
        directory is not part of the path related environment variable, the
        symbolic link will be created inside '/usr/bin' instead.

        After installing, you can directly run the 'salomon' command (system-
        wide) without having to give the full path to the main script.

        Now, to install, type one of the following commands depending on the
        way you prefer.

        Either as normal user via 'sudo'

            sudo ./install.sh -i

        or directly when logged in as root:

            ./install.sh -i

        After installing Salomon, the main script can be run by executing the
        'salomon' command (without a trailing '.sh') followed by the arguments
        to use. For example:

            salomon --help

    5. Uninstall Salomon

        Notice that this process also requires superuser privileges.

        Either as normal user via 'sudo'

            sudo ./install.sh -u

        or directly when logged in as root:

            ./install.sh -u
