    1. Definition

        The Salomon installation script allows to install and uninstall the
        project, which is optional and not mandatory in order to use it.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 Overview of all command-line arguments

            The script requires command-line arguments to operate. You can get
            an overview of all arguments available, by simply running the
            script with the '--help' argument.

        2.2 Shell requirements

            The Salomon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell,
            which is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least
            on many Linux distributions).

            No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell must be
            installed in order to use the project.

            Further information can be found inside the included documentation
            for the shell compatibility script.

    3. Verify archive integrity

        Since version 1.18.3 there is a checksum file to verify the integrity
        of the downloaded salomon-release archive. When downloading Salomon
        from its official repository, verifying the downloaded file is not
        mandatory.

        However, when downloading the archive from a different location, it
        might have been modified (in a not necessarily negative way), e.g.
        enhanced with additional color config files or whatever. As with any
        software, you should check it before running or installing it with
        superuser privileges.

        In order to verify the integrity of the archive you have downloaded,
        you will need the corresponding checksum file.

        For example, if you want to verify the file

            salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz

        download the checksum file

            salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz.sha256

        directly from the assets of the official release, with this particular
        version:

            https://github.com/urbanware-org/salomon/releases/tag/1.18.3

        Then, copy the checksum file into the same directory from the archive
        and execute the following shell command:

            sha256sum -c salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz.sha256

        In case the archive is identical with the one from the official
        release, the command will confirm this as follows:

            salomon-release-1.18.3.tar.gz: OK

        Now you can extract the archive and after that remove the archive file
        itself as well as the checksum file if you want to.

    4. Install Salomon

        Notice that this process requires superuser privileges.

        The project will be installed to '/opt/salomon' and a symbolic link to
        its main script will be created in '/usr/local/bin' by default. If the
        directory is not part of the path related environment variable, the
        symbolic link will be created inside '/usr/bin' instead.

        After installing, you can directly run the 'salomon' command (system-
        wide) without having to give the full path to the main script.

        Now, to start the installation, run the 'install.sh' script. In case
        you are logged in as root 'sudo' can be omitted.

            sudo ./install.sh -i

        After installing Salomon, the main script can be run by executing the
        'salomon' command (without a trailing '.sh') followed by the arguments
        to use. For example:

            salomon --help

    5. Update Salomon

        You can also update Salomon using the installation script in case it
        is installed already.

        Simply download a newer version, extract its archive and run the
        installation script from there as described in section 4 above.

        When it shows the message that the target directory already exists and
        you can either only install the program relevant files and keep all
        config files and settings or perform a clean installation which will
        delete the directory and reinstall the original files, select "No".

        Nevertheless, it is recommended to backup the user-defined configs and
        settings first.

    6. Migrate config files from Salomon-BSD

        If the Salomon-BSD installation directory ('/opt/salomon-bsd') exists
        on your system, you can migrate the config files from Salomon-BSD to
        Salomon.

        Before migrating the config files it is recommended to create a backup
        first.

        The following steps require superuser privileges. In case you are
        logged in as root, 'sudo' can be omitted.

        6.1 Migration with a new Salomon installation

            When installing Salomon, you will be prompted whether you want to
            migrate the config files or not.

            After confirming the migration the installation process will copy
            the config files as follows:

                - /opt/salomon-bsd/*.cfg      ->  /opt/salomon
                - /opt/salomon-bsd/colors/*   ->  /opt/salomon/colors
                - /opt/salomon-bsd/filters/*  ->  /opt/salomon/filters

            The Salomon-BSD installation directory (including all files) will
            remain untainted.

            After the installation is completed you can uninstall Salomon-BSD
            by simply removing its installation directory:

                sudo rm -fR /opt/salomon-bsd

            Do not use the '/opt/salomon-bsd/install.sh' script to uninstall
            Salomon-BSD it as this would cause problems with the current
            Salomon installation.

        6.2 Migration with Salomon already installed

            The easiest and recommended way is to manually copy them as
            follows:

                sudo cp /opt/salomon-bsd/salomon.cfg    /opt/salomon
                sudo cp /opt/salomon-bsd/colors/*       /opt/salomon/colors
                sudo cp /opt/salomon-bsd/filters/*      /opt/salomon/filters

            When done, you can uninstall Salomon-BSD by simply removing its
            installation directory:

                sudo rm -fR /opt/salomon-bsd

            Do not use the '/opt/salomon-bsd/install.sh' script to uninstall
            Salomon-BSD it as this would cause problems with the current
            Salomon installation.

    7. Uninstall Salomon

        Notice that this process also requires superuser privileges. In case
        you are logged in as root 'sudo' can be omitted.

            sudo ./install.sh -u
